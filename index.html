    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p> my name is Enwelum chiamaka, i am a 21 year old girl living in lagos nigeria. I am from anambra state.
        I joined altschool because i wanted to know more about tech, i was always intersted in computers and apps 
        i always told myself that one day id make an app. so when i saw an oppurtunity to study tech withut having to go through
        the stress of getting into a reputable university i took it.
    </p>
    <h2>Goals for the school</h2>

        set me up for the future in terms of jobseeking and also apps thatll be globally recognized.
